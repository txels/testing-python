# Testing with Python

Get up to speed into writing valuable automated test suites using Python.

# Why do we write tests?

--

# Some (very few) definitions

- **SUT** (System Under Test)
- **Regression**

--

# Types of tests

The are many ways to classify tests... E.g.:

- **Unit** test vs **Integration** test
- **Blackbox** vs **Whitebox** test

--

# Blackbox

# Whitebox

# Valuable tests

A valuable test is a test that:

- Has a **high chance** of **catching a regression** bug.
- Has a **low chance** of producing a **false positive**.
- Provides **fast feedback**.

# Styles of unit tests

--

## Functional

--

## State Verification

![](http://i2.wp.com/i.imgur.com/jf6zSIj.jpg?resize=463%2C186)


--

## Collaboration Verification

--

## Property Based

Its goal is to prove logical properties your system should fulfill.

> Think of it as *functional on steroids*:
>
>    For all data matching some specification,
>    Perform some operations on the data,
>    Assert something about the result.


-- center

# Value proposition for each style

--

## The Functional style:

- Has the best protection against false positives.
- Among all other parts of the SUT, its input and output tend to change less frequently during refactorings

--

## The State Verification style:

- Is more prone to false positives
- Is still good enough as long as we verify the SUT’s state via its public API.

> It’s still unlikely to produce false positives because the SUT’s public API tends to stay in place in the face of refactoring or addition of new functionality

--

## The Collaboration Verification style:

This is where the value of unit tests starts to degrade.

- The collaborations the SUT goes through in order to achieve its goal are not part of its public API.
- Introduces coupling between the tests and the SUT’s implementation details.


--

## To get the most of your unit tests

Treat the system you are testing in as black-box manner as possible.

> It will help you avoid coupling tests to the SUT’s implementation details and urge you to find ways to verify the observable state of the system instead.

-- heading

# Let's write us some tests!

--

# The setup

You can follow examples if you have a laptop with:

- Python 3
- 3rd party libraries: `hamcrest`
   - if time allows [`ddt`, `hypothesis`]

--

## Keep tests readable

Think of a test as an **executable specification**.

- Computers should be able to run it
- **Humans** can use them to understand how the system is expected to work

--

## Keep your test suites structured

### Goal: traceability from code to tests

E.g. given a module, it should be trivial to find where its unit tests live.

--

## Readability tips

- Test function names should express intent of the test
- Keep the test cases small
- Follow a consistent structure

--

# Anatomy of a test case

```
def test_something_something_kills_strings():

    # prepare: create test data and set up SUT

    # exercise: call your SUT

    # verify: check for expected outcomes
```

This pattern is also called **Arrange, Act, Assert**

--

## A concrete example:


```
def test_something_something_kills_strings():
    test_data = 'hello'
    sut = StringManipulator()

    result = sut.something_something(test_data)

    self.assertEqual(result, 'hello is now dead')
```

--

# Tools for writing and running tests

From standard library:
- `unittest`

Alternatives:
- `nosetests`
- `pytest`

# unittest crash course

Everything you need to know in 2 simple slides

--

## Write tests

```
from unittest import TestCase

class TestSomething(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):

    def test_unittest_assertions_actually_work(self):
        # ...
        self.assertTrue(True)
        self.assertFalse(False)
        self.assertEqual('hello', 'hello')
        # ...

    def tearDown(self):

```

--

## Run tests

Whole suite:
```
$ python -m unittest discover
```

A specific module:
```
$ python -m unittest test.songs.test_stats
```

A specific test class:
```
$ python -m unittest test.songs.test_stats.TestCounter
```

## Writing tests for existing code

vs

## Writing new code, guided by tests
(aka TDD: Test Driven Development)

# Your new job

Just hired by a startup that is going to disrupt the music industry.

Core technology: lyrics analysis.

Recommendation to users based on mood, songs they like...

--

# The talk and exercise

```
git clone git@github.com:txels/testing-python.git
```

--

# Testable/Maintainable code

Separate code which contains business logic from code that has volatile dependencies (don't mix both).

- Volatile dependencies: work with the outside world, e.g. the database or an external HTTP service.
- Stable dependencies: self-contained, don’t interact with off-process resources
